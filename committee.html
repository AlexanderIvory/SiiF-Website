        <p>Each year, the Melbourne Microfinance Initiative scopes more projects and student engagement events that align with our impact-focused vision. To that end, we continue to recruit the most passionate and driven university students to our ever-expanding sub-committee.</p>
        <p>Our organisational structure has always been founded on two main divisions: Operations and Initiatives. </p>
        <p>Our Operations portfolios focus on organising events at campus to further professional development and awareness about the opportunities that exist in social impact sphere amongst students all over Australia.</p>
        <p>Our Initiatives teams are the lifeblood of what our club is all about. They work on year-long consulting projects in collaboration with NFPs all over Southeast Asia and Australia. Initiative projects provide a space where students can apply their knowledge and skills to urgent organisational problems in order to create real, tangible impact. </p>
